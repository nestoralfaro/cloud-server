# Cloud Server Project

The following is a mock-up cloud application built with `NodeJS` and `handlebars`. You are able to delete directories, files, create directories, navigate through the directories, upload and download files, as well as viewing the files that your browser supportsâ€“e.g., .txt, .png, etc.

Clone the repository and while in the application's directory run `npm run start` to execute it on your local machine. All the files uploaded will be stored in the `files` directories.
